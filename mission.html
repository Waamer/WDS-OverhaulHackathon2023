            Stephanie Wong's mission with InkLink is rooted in her personal journey of overcoming language 
            barriers as an immigrant student in Canada. Fueled by her tech-savvy entrepreneurship, Stephanie 
            founded InkLink with the vision of revolutionizing learning accessibility. InkLink, more than 
            just a note-taking app, stands out for its commitment to inclusivity. Stephanie's dedication is 
            evident in the app's features, designed to empower two key user groups: students grappling with 
            language barriers and those facing challenges in taking traditional notes due to disabilities. 
            These diverse users are collectively known as "Inklings." InkLink goes beyond conventional note-taking,
             offering innovative solutions such as speech-to-text functions, screen readers, text-to-speech
              capabilities, language translations, and captioning. Stephanie envisions a warm, inviting 
              website with a simple design, prioritizing accessibility considerations like alternative texts,
               resizable fonts, high contrast, and zoom capabilities. As Canada's immigrant population grows, 
               so does the potential impact of InkLink, bridging language gaps for newcomers. Additionally, 
               the app addresses the needs of students with disabilities, providing a centralized platform for 
               seamless note-sharing. Stephanie's mission is an inspiring journey toward a more accessible world 
               of learning, and with InkLink, she aspires to redefine how education accommodates every learner.
